This is an application that can be used to make a library of the PDF files on your computer. 
The application shows the cover page of each book as an image on a bookshelf. 
You can create bookshelves by scanning existing folders on your computer for PDF files or by adding PDF files manually.
The search function allows you to quickly find books. You can search in the meta-information of the PDF books or
do a fast full-text search on all the PDF content in the library (with the use of a search-index).
